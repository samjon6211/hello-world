# hello-world 

My name is Carlos.  I've have always been interested in programing/coding. However, like a lot of many out in the "real" world, I've always been a little scared and wondering if I can do this or not.  My goal is to get this coding, especially being free of cost, completed in 2 to 3 months.

changes are a description about myself
my first program "again"
